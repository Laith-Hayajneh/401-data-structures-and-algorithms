## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. Understood the problem first
2. Solve it without using any bulit in method.
3.  Creating a copy of the Linked List.
4. Iterating over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
5. In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node.
